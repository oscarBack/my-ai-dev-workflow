# AI Agent Instructions for my-ai-dev-workflow

## Overview
This repository documents the evolution of personal AI development workflows and experiments to achieve better usage of AI tools. It serves as a knowledge base for refining AI-assisted development practices.

## Architecture
- **README.md**: Central overview and entry point for the repository
- **workflows/**: Directory containing individual workflow documentation as markdown files
- Simple documentation-focused structure without complex software components

## Key Components
- [README.md](README.md): Main documentation hub describing the repository's purpose
- [workflows/first-ai-workflow.md](workflows/first-ai-workflow.md): Example workflow file (currently empty, awaiting content)

## Developer Workflows
- **Adding Workflows**: Create new `.md` files in `workflows/` documenting specific AI workflows, including tools used, processes, and lessons learned
- **Updating Documentation**: Modify [README.md](README.md) to reflect new workflows or significant changes
- **Extending Capabilities**: Use the skills system for enhancements (e.g., `npx skills add https://github.com/softaworks/agent-toolkit --skill mermaid-diagrams` for diagram generation)

## Conventions
- Use markdown format for all documentation files
- Name workflow files descriptively (e.g., `experiment-with-copilot.md`)
- Document experiments with clear outcomes, challenges, and insights
- Focus on practical AI tool usage patterns rather than software development

## Integration Points
- **Skills System**: Leverages external skills toolkit for AI enhancements and diagram creation
- **External Dependencies**: Relies on `npx` and skills repositories for functionality extensions
- **AI Tools**: Integrates with various AI coding assistants (Copilot, Claude, etc.) as documented in workflows

## Patterns
- Prioritize documenting workflow evolution over static instructions
- Include specific examples of tool integrations and process improvements
- Reference key files like [README.md](README.md) and workflow files in `workflows/` for context
